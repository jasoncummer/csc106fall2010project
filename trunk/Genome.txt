Genome:

	Represented as an array of binary data, where each cell
	is responsible for a certain characteristic.
	Has an "expression" factor (or a binary dominant/recesive),
	as well as the strength of the gene. This strength is calculated 
	by turning the binary string into a mathematical expression:
		00:- 01:+ 10:/ 11:x
		ints 0-15 (4 bit)
		length: 6n+4 of form ioioioi (int, operator)
	
	Replecation energy is used in the number and length of genes
	replecated. The longer the genes, the more energy is used up.
	
	The longer a gene, the more likely (polynomial/exponential pdf)
	that a mutation will cause it to become shorter.
	
	
	Mutations can cause substitution, insertion, or deletion of a
	single bit, following an exponetial pdf. Also, but much less likely,
	reversals of a whole segment.
